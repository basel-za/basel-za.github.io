<b>Motivation</b> <br>
Experts spend considerable time and effort manually analyzing stained tissue biopsies for cancer diagnosis. <br>
These efforts can be drastically reduced with computer-aided AI systems. <br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b> <br>
Develop a tool that automatically detects, classifies, and segments cells in stained tissue biopsies. <br>
<br>
<b>Tasks:</b> <br>
1- Develop an image registration algorithm to construct a full biopsy image. <br>
2- Develop an image processing algorithm using OpenCV to pre-process images. <br>
3- Develop a machine learning model to detect cells in the biopsies, segment them, and categorize them as malignant or benign. <br>
4- Develop an algorithm that extracts various features from the biopsies and applies statistical analysis to aid expert diagnosis.<br>
