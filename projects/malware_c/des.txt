<b>Motivation</b><br>
Applying effective cyber deception techniques to malware requires a high-level characterization of its behavior.  <br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b> <br>
Develop a model that identifies the malicious behavior of Win32 API traces from malware by linking them to specific techniques in ATT&CK.<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b> <br>
1- Build a tool, SODA, that automatically applies deception techniques to malware using API hooking. <br>
2- Collect Win32 API-related data from MSDN, Stack Overflow, and GitHub in a code-description dataset to leverage it in a weakly supervised learning approach. <br>
3- Train a model that uses statistical analysis and language models to analyze an API trace and characterize it to a specific TTP from ATT&CK. <br>
