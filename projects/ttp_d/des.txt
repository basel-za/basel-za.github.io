<b>Motivation</b> <br>
Developing threat information ontologies is essential for understanding cyber attacks.<br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b><br>
Build a tool that automatically constructs an ontology of attack behaviors across semantic gaps, from low-level malicious code to high-level attack objectives.<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b><br>
1- Design the ontology by identifying and defining various attack behaviors and their interrelationships. <br>
2- Harvest LLMs' knowledge and mine public data to construct the ontology. <br>
3- Employ chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot learning techniques to train LLMs for automatic ontology expansion. <br>
