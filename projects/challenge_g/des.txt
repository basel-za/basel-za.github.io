<b>Motivation</b> <br>
Challenge-response is a widely used mechanism for user verification. However, it is vulnerable to evasion by attackers who can employ social engineering tactics or gather information to guess or steal the necessary credentials.<br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b><br>
Develop a tool that generates dynamic challenge questions from conversation history to verify the identity of a user. These questions are easily answerable by the user and impossible for anyone else to answer.<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b><br>
1- Constructing a criteria for evaluating generated questions.<br>
2- Fine-tune a transformer language model on an email corpus to extract rich features.<br>
3- Extract various natural language features that are associated with the criteria.<br>
4- Train deep learning models that generate challenge questions.<br>
