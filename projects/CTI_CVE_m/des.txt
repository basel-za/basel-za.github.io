<b>Motivation</b> <br>
ATT&CK is a knowledge base that categorizes real-world attack activities into tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). <br>
CVE is a list of disclosed vulnerabilities in public software, and CTI reports provide technical analysis of real-world attacks. <br>  
Mapping CVE and CTI reports to ATT&CK enriches them with additional context, accelerates threat response, and facilitates collaboration and information sharing among organizations.<br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b><br>
Build a tool that automatically maps CVE and CTI reports to appropriate ATT&CK techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>Approach</b><br>
1- Develop a semantic extraction algorithm to extract attack vectors from ATT&CK, CTE reports, and CVE.<br>
2- Finetune a language model using the SIAMESE network to maximize the cosine similarity between phrases extracted from the same techniques and minimize it otherwise.<br>
3- Use the finetuned language model to extract semantically rich embedding of attack vectors.<br>
4- Train a logistic regression model to classify extracted attack behaviors into techniques.<br>
